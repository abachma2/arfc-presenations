  \begin{itemize}
  \item Look at results of normal criticality, compare them with limits

  \item Evaluate how some of these changes affect reactor materials
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Large temperature swings, inducing stresses and strains
      \item Computationally look at how these affect material performance and expected lifetime
    \end{itemize}
  \item Investigate how the times tep size impacts the results
  \item Authors propose examining other transient scenarios
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Look specifically at start up and shot dowm scenarios -- normal operation of their transients and accident scenarios
  
    \end{itemize}
    \item Authors also propose using this methodology for analysis of other reactor types
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Sodium Fast Reactors
      \item HTGRs, both with TRISO and prismatic fuel
      \item Authors suggest PWRs -- could gain insight for heat carried by the water
    \end{itemize}
